    "Tea is the most popular beverage, next to water, in the world, the story of tea begins in China. According to legend, in 2737 BC, the Chinese emperor Shen Nung was sitting beneath a tree while his servant boiled drinking water, when some leaves from the tree blew into the water.Whilst the custom of drinking tea dates back to the third millennium BC in China and was popularized in England during the 1660s by King Charles II and his wife the Portuguese Infanta Catherine de Braganza, it was not until the mid-19th century that the concept of ‘afternoon tea’ first appeared.Tea production is one of the main sources of foreign exchange for Sri Lanka and accounts for Employments directly or indirectly, over 1 million people, and in 1995 directly employed 215,338 on tea plantations and estates. Sri Lanka is the world’s fourth-largest producer of Tea. In 1995, it was the world’s leading exporter of Tea The humidity, cool temperatures, and rainfall of the country’s central highlands provide a climate that favors the production of high-quality tea. The industry was introduced to the country in 1867 by James Taylor, a British planter who arrived in 1852. The major tea growing areas are Kandy and NuwaraEliya in Central Province Badulla, Bandarawela and Haputale , Sri Lanka’s hill district is carpeted with beautiful terraced tea plantations. Perhaps the most famous is Lipton Tea original plantation near Haputale, which still grows and sells a variety of teas",
